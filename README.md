# BnP-Travel-Packer-Capstone
This capstone project is an app to alleviate the burden that people have with packing for a trip: Over/Under-packing, and forgetting crucial items.
The user fills out a form to create a new trip and gives the number of bags they plan on taking with them. Within the trip details, they can edit their desired trip date and add/remove items they desire to pack with them.
This mobile app was created on Swift/SwiftUI + Firebase/Firestore tech stack.
